# MadRace3D
This is a Game I'v made in a technical test for a game development company.

## H2 Answered Questions:

## H2 The time it took you to perform the exercise
4:20 hours aprox, the rest half hour im using to upload the project.

## H2 The parts that were difficult for you and why
I struggled with the physics, i'v never made a 3d car game so I tried to figure out if the best way was to use a wheel collider or should i use something simpler, but due to the lack of the time I couldn't research all I would wanted, so I take the desition of making it just move towards check points with transform translation.

## H2 The parts you think you could do better and how
I could have make a lot better the player behaviour by adding physics forces instead of using transform translations, also the map design is very cumbersome becose im not very used to work with pro builder, so i did what i could, but i could improve a lot the map design. Other thing is the obstacles, i could make some obstacles more interesting and more challenging, if i had more time. Last thing i am missing is to apply some design pattern to make the project tidier, like the observer pattern, so i dont need to reference all my gameobjects in many classes.

## H2 What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I would add more level, coins, time limit, global leaderboard and many more mechanics to make it more challenging.

## H2 What did you think
Im happy with my work, it was fun and painful a little bit, but i feel i'v made a decent product for less than 5 hours, still i think i could improve my habilities a lot more if i work hard.

## H2 Any comment you may have
Thank you for this oportunity, im learning a lot!
